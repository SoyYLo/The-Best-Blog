# The-Best-Blog

## User Story
As a developer I want to create a webpage for my first online blog
So that I may display my work, projects and thoughts for viewrs to read

## Description
When the webpage loads I am presented with a form to fill out. I will be able to enter my username, the title for my blog post, and write a short paragraph about my blog post.
When I click submit the information is stored in local storage and I am taken to a second page that will display all my content. 
There will be a header with an option to go back and return to the previous page. There will also be an option to change the theme of the second page if I want to enable the dark mode. 
I will be able to visibly view and read my new blog post. The page will include a footer with additional information about me, including a link so visit my online Portfolio.
